# User Management System 
## Author - Abdul Oketunde

## Overview 
This project aimed to test my knowledge of the Angular framework. My task was to create a user management system with CRUD functionality.

I used Springboot to make the API's and mySQL to store the data. The system can add, update, delete and filter/search through the list of users on the table.
